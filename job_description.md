# Contract

First part will be the contract implementation.
Our goal is to create an efficient contract, that will support our community with low gas fees on minting and when trading.
**We want to draw inspiration from two main contracts**, one is Azuki's (which from my understanding is now available as ERC721A) and the second one is Nuclear Nerds' contract which is explained in this Medium post.
The contract should support the following

 1. Buying and selling with royalties
 2. Whitelist Minting
 3. OG minting - this is the same as the whitelist minting, but the OG addresses will be allowed to mint a greater quantity
 4. Public minting
 5. Airdrops
 6. Reveal functionality - display one image on minting for all the tokens, then few days later we'll reveal the real images
 7. All minted tokens should appear in OpenSea.io

### Definition of Done

This stage is done once the contract has been implemented and tested on one of the test nets.
The test will test all the functionalities mentioned above.

# Mint website

The second part is the mint website.
For this part as input, you'll get a design (only images, layers in PNG or other format) and you'll implement the minting site. The minting site will enable connecting a wallet (MetaMask and Coinbase) and minting, supporting all the minting features mentioned in the "Contract" section.

The website should interact with the contract implemented before.

### Definition of Done

This stage is done once the website has been tested with the contract on a test net and the implementation of the design is approved by us (The Little Surfers)

# Deployment

Last part is deployment, deploying the website under our domain (we already have a domain) and the contract in the Ethereum blockchain

## Definition of Done

This part is where the project ends, once all is deployed and ready for our audience to mint.

# Extras

Through the entire body of work we expect clarity, fairness and communication and we will conduct in the same standard.
We expect you to be available for questions and explain the progress when necessary and to do your best to ensure the quality and success of the project
